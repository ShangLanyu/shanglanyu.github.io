### Short Bio

I am currently a Ph.D. student in the [School of Information Sciences (iSchool)](https://ischool.illinois.edu/) at the [University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign (UIUC)](https://illinois.edu/) under the supervision of [Dr. Dong Wang](https://www.wangdong.org/). I received an M.S. in [Data Science](https://cds.nyu.edu) from [New York University (NYU)](http://www.nyu.edu) and a B.S. in [Applied Mathematics](https://ww3.math.ucla.edu) from the [University of California - Los Angeles (UCLA)](https://www.ucla.edu). 

My research interest lies in social sensing, machine learning, natural language processing, and network science. I am particularly interested in social media based data mining and analysis, such as multimodal misinformation detection on social media and multimodal information retrieval.
